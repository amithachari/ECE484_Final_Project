# ECE484_Final_Project
The problem is to plan and follow a trajectory from point A to point B avoiding obstacles with smaller errors. Planning: Determine the trajectory that GEM has to follow, this is done using sampling based planning, namely RRT* Control: Control the vehicle to track the trajectory resulted from planning using a PID controller.
